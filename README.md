# Diabetes Health Indicators Prediction

## Overview
This project is a Machine Learning application that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on health-related indicators.  
The goal of this project is to analyze health data, extract meaningful patterns, and build a predictive model that can assist in early diabetes risk assessment.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains health indicators such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Blood Pressure
- Blood Glucose Level
- Physical Activity
- Smoking Status
- Cholesterol Level
- Family History of Diabetes

The target variable represents whether a person is likely to have diabetes or not.

## Project Workflow
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature selection and scaling  
4. Model training and evaluation  
5. Performance analysis and visualization  

## Machine Learning Model
- Model Type: Classification  
- Algorithms Used: Logistic Regression / Random Forest  
- Evaluation Metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score

## Results
The model demonstrates reasonable performance in predicting diabetes risk based on health indicators.  
Visualizations are included to show feature importance and data relationships.
